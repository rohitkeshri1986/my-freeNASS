The following behavioral changes should be noted for anyone upgrading from
earlier builds of FreeNAS (any version) to 9.3-RELEASE

1. This build now uses ZFS, the GRUB boot loader, and GPT partition labels for
all boot media.  This is a significant change from earlier releases and may
cause interoperability issues with older hardware / BIOSes.  In the event of a
failed upgrade, one possible remedy may be to back up your configuration
database and try a fresh install using the 9.3-RELEASE ISO installation image
(which can also be used from USB devices).

2. Because it is now possible to accumulate an arbitrary number of ZFS boot
environments, the recommended default installation media size is now 8GB.
For maximum reliability, at least a pair of 8GB devices is suggested.  Smaller
(4GB) media will still work, but space will be very tight and the number of
boot environments will need to be managed very carefully lest future update
attempts fail due to lack of space.

3. Authenticating via LDAP now requires that the connection to the LDAP server
be SSL/TLS.  This prevents account passwords from being sent in clear-text but
may be an unexpected change in behavior for users upgrading from older releases
of FreeNAS.

4. The CTL LUN serial number generator has been changed to match the previous
istgt (userland iSCSI) behavior for compatibility.  This was done after the
9.3-BETA, so those who switched to the Experimental iSCSI target in 9.2.1.x
or used iSCSI in 9.3-BETA will see a serial number change.
